    "description": "Researchers at Rapid7 have detected around 2,000 Linux servers online that suffer from a critical vulnerability. The vulnerability, which resides in the in-memory data structure store Redis, has already been exploited in the wild.\n\nThe threat\nThe vulnerability has been given a CVE number of CVE-2022-0543, and a CVSS score of 10. It is an insufficient sanitization issue in the Lua programming language. Redis statically links the Lua Library, and some Debian or Ubuntu packages dynamically link it as well. Hence, it allows a sandbox escape that can be exploited by attackers to perform remote code execution (RCE).",

As a result, attackers can modify arbitrary files from the targeted system.\n\nImpact\nWhen extracting untrusted source packages in v2 and v3 source package formats that include a debian.tar, the in-place extraction can lead to directory traversal situations on specially crafted orig.tar and debian.tar tarballs.",
